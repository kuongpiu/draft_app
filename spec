Requirements
1. Want to save current working status like relative links (blog, youtube...), files...
2. Want a way to restore all saved things and continue the work
3. Want to save all the things in a draft in an elegant way
4. Support tagging for category draft
Draft file content: some pictures, some notes, if click on pictures -> show the source (user can follow that source to get to full page or blog...)

Example
Context: Currently, i am studying sort algorithm

Openning tabs: tab1, tab2, tab3, tab4
Openning files: /home/opuser/sort.pdf page (20), /home/opuser/algorithms.pptx (slide 20)
Draft content: 2 pictures take from link A, 2 blocks of code from github, 12 text cut from /usr/opuser/sort.pdf

Then i need to move on to openstack issues
-> click save draft (A_draft)

Sometime later, i want to continue learning algorithms. i just click restore the draft
Then after i done this draft. i push it on the server (like sharing docs)
